##Finding suitable number of clusters

Histogram with 20 bins that is group according to eruption time can be show by:
```{r}
erup = df$eruptions 
rangErup = range(erup)
interval = seq(rangErup[1], rangErup[2], by=((rangErup[2]-rangErup[1])/20))
erup.interval = cut(erup,interval)
plot(erup.interval,xlab = "Eruption interval",ylab = "Freq",main = "Frequency of eruption's interval")
```
2 groups of data can be seen


Histogram with 20 bins that is group according to waiting time can be show by:
```{r}
wait = df$waiting 
rangeWait = range(wait)
interval =seq(rangeWait[1], rangeWait[2], by=((rangeWait[2]-rangeWait[1])/20))
erup.interval = cut(wait,interval)
plot(erup.interval,xlab = "Eruption interval",ylab = "Freq",main = "Frequency of eruption's interval")
```
2 groups of data can be seen

Scale data in to standard normal distribution with mean of 0 and sd of 1
```{r}
df = scale(df)
```



The optimal number of clusters can also be shown by using the Average Silhouette Method. 
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(df, FUN = hcut, method = "silhouette")
```
The Average Silhouette Method determines the quality of each cluster. The higher the number the better the clustering. From the graph 2 cluster maximizes the value.

Another way to determine the optimal is Elbow Method. 
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(df, FUN = hcut, method = "wss")
```
The Elbow Method computes how well the clusters is grouped together. The smaller the number means that the variance in each group is smaller. The value decrease abruply at 2 clusters.

Plot data so that groups can be seen, since there is only 2 dimension scatter plot will be used
```{r}
plot(df,type = 'p')
```
The plot shows that the data can be seperated by 2 groups

All of the above method suggest that the suitable number of clusters is 2

##K-means clustering

K-mean with 2 clusters. The algorithm will be run 10 times randomly choosing different centroids, the best one will be kept. 
```{r}
km = kmeans(df,centers = 2,nstart = 10)
km
```

The data can be plot as follows:
```{r}
fviz_cluster(list(data = df, cluster = km$cluster),labelsize = 0)
```

colnames(result) = c('Method','Agglomerative','Cophenetic Correlation',"Silhouette")
result
```

The Average Silhouette coefficient of all points are the same because all of the algorithm group data in the same manner.
The cophenetic correllation coefficient is used to evalute the hierarchical clusters, The higher the value the better. Using group average as the linking criteria maximizes the value.

Agglomerative coefficient shows the strenght of the cluster. Ward's method as the linkage criteria result in the highest Aggolomerative coeeficient.

##DBSCAN
Plot K Nearest Neighbor 
```{r}
kSeq = seq(5,100,10)

for (minK in kSeq){
  kNNdist(df, k=minK, search="kd")
  kNNdistplot(df, k=minK)
}
```
I have decided to select where K = 45 and the knee is around 0.5. So the DBSCAN will have the parameter of MinPts = 45 and Eps = 0.5

Create DBSCAN with above parameter
```{r}
db = dbscan(df,eps = 0.5,MinPts = 45)
db
```

Plot result of clusters from DBScan. The document stated that outliers in the DBSCAN will be 0. The cluster values will be added 1 so that the outlier will be plot in black.

```{r}
plot(df, col = db$cluster + 1)
```

Plot without outliers
```{r}
plot(df, col = db$cluster)
```

##Best Method For Faithful Dataset
Compare between DBSCAN, K-Mean and Hierachical Clustering (Group Average and Ward's Method)

###Compare each method using various evaluation measures
```{r}
results = c('average.between','average.within','avg.silwidth','within.cluster.ss')

statSum = cbind(cluster.stats(dist(df), clusGroupGA)[results],
cluster.stats(dist(df), clusGroupWM)[results],
cluster.stats(dist(df), db$cluster+1)[results],
cluster.stats(dist(df), -(db$cluster+1),noisecluster=TRUE)[results],
cluster.stats(dist(df), km$cluster)[results]
)

colnames(statSum)  = c('Group Average','Ward\'s Method',"DBSCAN with Outlier","DBSCAN without Outlier","K-Mean")

t(statSum)
```

A better cluster generally is compact with low variance in the group and the distance between each cluster is high relative to the variance. 

Evaluation measures:

* average.between: average distance between clusters
  + average.within: average distance within the clusters
  + avg.silwidth: Average silhouette width
  + within.cluster.ss: Within cluster's sum of squares 


Looking at the values the best method is DBSCAN even with the outliers included. The measures seems to show that DBSCAN is the most suitable method for this problem. Since it creates the most compact cluster that is well seperated.
